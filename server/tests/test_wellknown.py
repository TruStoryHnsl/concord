"""Tests for the Concord-specific ``/.well-known/concord/client`` endpoint.

Scope:
1. The endpoint returns 200 with JSON matching the
   ``ConcordClientWellKnown`` response model.
2. All four wire-contract fields are present (``api_base``,
   ``livekit_url``, ``instance_name``, ``features``) and carry values
   derived from the mocked env vars.
3. Auth is NOT required — well-known discovery must work before the
   client has any credentials. A request with no Authorization header
   must still return 200.
4. The env-var resolution paths are exercised independently:
   ``PUBLIC_BASE_URL`` override, ``CONDUWUIT_SERVER_NAME`` fallback,
   missing ``CONDUWUIT_SERVER_NAME`` landing on the explicit sentinel.
5. The ``features`` list is the stable hard-coded list from
   ``_advertised_features`` — pinning it here catches accidental
   removals that would break deployed native clients.

These tests intentionally stay hermetic: they mock env via
``monkeypatch`` and do not touch any real container state.
